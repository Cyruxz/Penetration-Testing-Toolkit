 Penetration Testing Toolkit – Project Description
This project is a modular Python-based penetration testing toolkit designed to help identify security weaknesses in target systems. It includes several key tools commonly used in ethical hacking and vulnerability assessments. Each module is built to perform a specific task and can be run individually via a command-line interface.

The toolkit includes the following modules:

Port Scanner – Scans a target host for open ports.

FTP Brute-Forcer – Attempts to gain access by trying multiple passwords on an FTP server.

SSH Brute-Forcer – Uses a wordlist to brute-force SSH logins.

Directory Brute-Forcer – Discovers hidden directories on a web server using a wordlist.

Banner Grabber – Collects service banners to identify software versions running on open ports.

The script is structured in a modular way to allow easy customization and expansion. Users can run specific modules with arguments like --mode, --target, --ports, --user, and --wordlist. Wordlists used for brute-force attacks or directory discovery are stored in a separate folder for easy management.

The toolkit uses standard Python libraries like socket, ftplib, paramiko, and requests, making it lightweight and easy to set up on any system with Python installed. It is intended for use in educational, learning, and authorized security testing environments only.
